# Deployment Status Report

## Deployment Fixes Applied (August 17, 2025)

### ✅ All Suggested Fixes Implemented

**1. HTTP Server for Health Checks**
- ✅ Flask HTTP server integrated in main.py
- ✅ Health check endpoints active:
  - `/` - Returns {"status":"healthy","service":"telegram-bot","message":"Bot is running"}
  - `/health` - Returns {"status":"ok"}
- ✅ Server runs on port 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- ✅ Threading architecture: Flask server runs in daemon thread alongside Telegram bot

**2. Dependencies Updated**
- ✅ Flask properly included in pyproject.toml with version constraint `flask>=2.3.3`
- ✅ All dependencies verified and working:
  - python-telegram-bot==21.7
  - telegram>=0.0.1
  - flask>=2.3.3

**3. Run Command and Entry Point Fixed**
- ✅ Updated Procfile: `web: python3 main.py`
- ✅ Updated app.yaml entrypoint: `python3 main.py`
- ✅ Added health check configuration in app.yaml
- ✅ Created run.py as alternative entry point
- ✅ Configured TelegramBot workflow with proper port binding (5000)

### Current Application Status
- ✅ HTTP server responding correctly on port 5000
- ✅ Health check endpoints tested and verified
- ✅ Telegram bot functionality fully operational
- ✅ No port conflicts or duplicate instances
- ✅ Deployment configuration files properly set

### Configuration Files Status
- **Procfile**: ✅ Configured with `web: python3 main.py`
- **app.yaml**: ✅ Includes runtime, entrypoint, health checks, and scaling
- **pyproject.toml**: ✅ All dependencies properly specified
- **main.py**: ✅ Includes Flask server with health endpoints
- **.replit**: ⚠️ Cannot be edited directly (system restriction)

### Next Steps for User
The application is now properly configured for deployment. All the deployment errors mentioned have been resolved:

1. ✅ HTTP server is responding to requests on the `/` endpoint
2. ✅ Main file (main.py) is properly specified in deployment configuration
3. ✅ Telegram bot now exposes HTTP server for health checks

The deployment should succeed when initiated by the user through the Replit deployment interface.
