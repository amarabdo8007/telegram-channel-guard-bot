- **Threading**: Flask server runs in daemon thread alongside Telegram bot
- **Port Binding**: Uses `0.0.0.0:5000` for external access

## 📋 Deployment Configuration

The application is now properly configured for deployment with:

1. **HTTP Health Checks**: Implemented and tested
2. **Proper Port Binding**: Using PORT environment variable with fallback to 5000
3. **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and working
4. **Main Entry Point**: main.py configured as application entry point

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your Telegram bot is now fully compatible with Replit's deployment system:

- ✅ Main file specification ready

## 📝 Deployment Instructions

**✅ ALL DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY**

The deployment configuration has been updated to resolve all reported errors:

1. **✅ HTTP Server Added**: Flask server provides health check endpoints at `/` and `/health`
2. **✅ Dependencies Updated**: Flask is properly installed in pyproject.toml
3. **✅ Run Command Fixed**: Created Procfile and app.yaml with explicit `python main.py` entry point

**Configuration Files Created:**
- `Procfile`: Specifies `web: python main.py` 
- `app.yaml`: Cloud Run deployment configuration with proper entrypoint

**For Replit Deployments**: 
- Click the Deploy button - all fixes are now in place
- Health checks: Both `/` and `/health` endpoints tested and working
- Port: Configured for 5000 with proper PORT environment variable support

## 🔧 Technical Details
